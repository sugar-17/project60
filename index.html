        <p class="para">My hobby is reading horror and mystery comics in my free time. Whenever I go to home from my school I like to read such comics after completing my home work. I am 12 years old and study in grade 7th. Now I know very well that reading is really really fun. This hobby can be developed by anyone however I got this naturally. Reading comics keep one always happy and busy. It is the good source of enjoyment and inspiration. My second hobby is researching in google its really fun and knowledgeable to research in google. I search about new words, aquatic animals, diseases, earth, nature, time in other countries,new maths tricks etc...
